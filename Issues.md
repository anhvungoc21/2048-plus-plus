## **Known Unresolved Issues:**

1. Input speed is slowed down due to async/await-ing tile transitions. Tried resolving this to no avail.
2. Display on smaller devices are terrible. Need to accomodate for each device size.
3. (Resolved?) There's a chance of a 6-tile appearing when combo state is triggered while tiles are being slid.
