Todos:

1. Implement user log-in/out directly inside page with MongoDB. If logged in, get settings/highest score from Mongo. Else, load from localstorage.
2. Implement energy bar, When it’s full, all blocks that spawn are doubled. Basically have a config for the chance of blocks spawn chance/value.
   Progress bar CSS.

Unresolved Issues:
Input speed is slowed down due to async/await-ing tile transitions. Tried resolving this to no avail. 2. Need to accomodate for each device size. 3.
