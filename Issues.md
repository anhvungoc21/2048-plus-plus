## **Known Unresolved Issues:**

1. Input speed is slowed down due to async/await-ing tile transitions.
2. Display on smaller devices are terrible. Need to accomodate for each device size.
3. When toggling between login and signup modal quickly, there might be a jerky/flickering css transition.
4. (Resolved?) There's a chance of a 6-tile appearing when combo state is triggered while tiles are being slid.
