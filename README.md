A hyped-up and customizable version of the game 2048!

## Introduction

Hi there! Thanks for checking out my take on 2048. I love 2048 (even addicted to it at some point), so I decided, why not add some more features to make players' experience better?

## Features

- **Hype/Combo bar**: When multiple tiles are merged in succession within a short amount of time, the value of the tiles spawned will be increased (2 becomes 4 & 4 becomes 8). Also, all existing 2-tiles will become 4-tiles. I hope this creates a bigger incentive for players to speedrun the game!
- **Dark/Light appearance**: Pick one that suits your eyes!
- **Customizable color themes**: Choose a color theme to your liking. I'm not too good at color theory and stuff, so I've only added 2 colors for now. More to come!
- **Customizable board sizes**: The original 4-by-4 grid can be a little bit limiting, punishing, and prevents players from reaching higher scores. I've implemented 2 other board sizes that I think is reasonable. (Again, I can always add more!)

## Features to be implemented

- **Login system** for players to store their best scores and favorite settings. I am in the process of implementing this with a simple database!
