An customizable (and possible hyped-up) version of the game 2048!

## Introduction
Hi there! Thanks for checking out my take on 2048. I love 2048 (even addicted to it at some point), so I decided, why not add some more features to make players' experience better?

## Features
- **Dark/Light appearance**: Pick one that suits your eyes!
- **Customizable color themes**: Choose a color theme to your liking. I'm not too good at color theory and stuff, so I've only added 2 colors for now. More to come!
- **Customizable board sizes**: The original 4-by-4 grid can be a little bit limiting, punishing, and prevents players from reaching higher scores. I've implemented 2 other board sizes that I think is reasonable. (Again, I can always add more!)

## Features to be implemented
- **Hype/Combo bar**: When the player quickly merges multiple tiles in a short amount of time, the value of the tiles spawned will be increased. I hope this creates a bigger incentive for players to speedrun the game!
- **Better score display & animation**

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions about any features of the game. Have fun!

(P/s: I have not optimized the web app for phone/tablet users, please check this out on your computer!)
